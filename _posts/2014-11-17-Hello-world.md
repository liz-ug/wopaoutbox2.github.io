##THE WOMEN PASSION PROGRAM 2014
Enrolling for the first WOPA cohart is one of my achievements this year.Interacting and making friends with fellow girls with great minds and visions is simply owesome.
Being part of ateam which thinks and knows everything is possiple with technology is great and am loving it.

The sessions with Michael about self discovery introduced me to a whole new and exciting side of me,"determinig my own weather"
 Tina and Richard are simply owesome,they make me think that i can actually do business.

Now Lynns sessions are simply amazing.She makes difficult things look like a piece of cake.
